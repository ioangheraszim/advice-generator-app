## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have not learned much, just practiced more on my fetch function to interact with the advice generator api.

### Continued development
In future projects, I will prioritize refining my skills in three key areas: API integration, React framework, and JavaScript proficiency. By focusing on these areas, I aim to build dynamic applications, leverage the power of React for efficient UI development, and enhance my JavaScript expertise.
